# Java-OOP-Lab07-Abstract
A repository for Object Oriented Programming subject assignment: Lab 7; Abstract

The reason why I choose to send you this github link is because the aspect of Access Modifier where it implements package and protected methods, which means ot requires folder for each package accordingly(I don't know what I just said so to further summarize, you can download it and run it from each folder. The package name is the folder those files are kept in, thus you do not need to create a folder with that name and copy-paste them in)

This lab is really tought but it was fun...
